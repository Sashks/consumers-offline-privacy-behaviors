\subsection{Interview Guideline}
\label{interview_guide}

\subsubsection{Opening statement of the interview} 

Hello, I am a student at KIT. I am doing a research on privacy and  really appreciate your participation. This interview will be conducted mainly through some opinion questions and behavioral questions. The content of the interview will be kept strictly confidential! To ensure the validity of the interview, please answer each question truthfully, and if there are no questions, let's get started! 

\subsubsection{Interview dialogue}

Dialogue section:
\begin{addmargin}[4em]{1em}
    
1. Can you think of a thing that you do when you are outside that protects your privacy in some way?

Note: Answers will often include online and offline examples. Try to steer the conversation into the offline.

2. Let's consider \textit{*example of offline behavior*}, for example, have you noticed something interesting that people do, or you do in such situations?

Note: After the interviewee has no examples left, present them with some interesting behaviors from previous interview sessions.

3. Have you witnessed or can you think of similar things that people do in their daily lives?

4. What is it that people are trying to protect?

5. What are their expectations?

6. How effective is \textit{*example of offline behavior*}, in your opinion?

7. Do you consider yourself more privacy-conscious person than the average consumer?   
\end{addmargin}

Interview steps:
\begin{addmargin}[4em]{1em}
1. Selecting the interview site 

2. Select the subject 

3. Take notes

4. Reflection and evaluation of the interview
